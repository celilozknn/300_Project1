## CMPE 300 Project 1
This repository contains the code and documentation for Project 1 of the CMPE 300 course. The project focuses on analysis of a given Hamiltonian Path, implementation of given pseduocode, and improving some parts of the algorithm benefiting from the construction of the graphs.

### Files in the Repository
- `graph_construction.py`: The file given by the instructor for graph construction.
- `solution.py`: This file contains the main implementation of the project, including graph construction,
    Hamiltonian Path analysis, and the improved algorithm.
